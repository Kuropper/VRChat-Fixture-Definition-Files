    "The system folder is where QLC+ resources (fixtures, input profiles, RGB scripts, etc) are installed and it changes
    depending on your operating system:
        Linux: it's a fixed folder named /usr/share/qlcplus
        Windows: it is the folder where you actually installed QLC+. By default: C:\QLC+
        Mac OS: it is a folder inside the QLC+ bundle (.app file). It is possible to browse the QLC+.app bundle contents simply with Finder. Just right click on the file and select "Show Package Contents".
    Otherwise, the system folder can be reached with a terminal but it depends on where you installed QLC+.
    For example if you dragged QLC+ into Applications it will be: /Applications/QLC+.app/Contents/Resources"
