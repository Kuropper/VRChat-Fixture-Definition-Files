# VRChat-Fixture-Definition-Files
A repo for sharing fixture profiles for fixtures that get used around VRChat, for as many softwares as possible

Getting into VRChat lighting design, one common thread I've seen around is that fixture profiles can often be hard to find, especially since there is a wide range of software used by LDs.
Im hoping to help remedy that with this repo!
